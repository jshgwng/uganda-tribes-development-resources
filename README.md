## Overview

Welcome to the Uganda Tribes Development Resources project. This open source initiative aims to provide valuable resources for various tribes in Uganda that can be utilized in software development projects. The project includes data in both JSON and SQL formats, making it accessible and adaptable for a wide range of applications.

## Features

- **JSON Format**: Explore tribe-related data in a structured JSON file, suitable for integration into diverse projects.
- **SQL Script**: Create a relational database using the SQL script, facilitating seamless incorporation into database-driven applications.

## Data Structure

The JSON file consists of an array of objects, each representing a tribe with relevant information. The SQL script is designed to create a table with columns corresponding to key attributes of each tribe.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Acholi",
    "population": 1500000,
    "languages": ["Acholi", "English"],
    "capital": "Gulu"
  },
  ...
]
```

## Usage

### JSON

Integrate the provided `tribes.json` file into your project to access valuable information about each tribe. Utilize the structured data for diverse software development applications.

### SQL

Execute the `tribes.sql` script to create a table named `tribes` in your database. This enables seamless incorporation of tribe data into your database-driven applications.

```sql
SELECT * FROM tribes WHERE id = 1;
```
